To create this application, we will need to create a backend server that serves the frontend files and handles the API requests to TMDB. We will use Node.js with Express.js for the backend and React for the frontend. 

Let's start with the backend.

The backend will have the following files:

1. `package.json`: This file will contain the project metadata and dependencies.
2. `server.js`: This is the entry point of our application. It will set up the Express server and handle the API requests.
3. `.env`: This file will contain environment variables such as the TMDB API key.

For the frontend, we will have the following files:

1. `public/index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will be served by our Express server.
2. `src/App.js`: This is the main React component that will contain the search box and handle the autocomplete functionality.
3. `src/index.js`: This is the entry point of our React application. It will render the `App` component into the `index.html` file.
4. `package.json`: This file will contain the project metadata and dependencies for the frontend.

Let's start with the backend files.

`package.json`
